                                                <p>A renowned watercolor artist who was born in Ukraine and found her new found home in Israel, Bat-Yam has developed a form of Modern Art which is true to details and colors. Greatly influenced by European cultures with a mixture of Middle Eastern flavor.<br>&nbsp; <br>
                                                    Svetlana defines her artwork as "Lyrical Impressionism". She not only defines the world through the senses of sight and feelings but also arouses the inner emotion of desire. Ms. Lukash holds a dialouge with nature around her. She exhibits this dialouge with her landscape as well as her still life. The colors are not only vivid but outlines a true sense of movement which she herself only holds.<br>&nbsp; <br>
                                                    Svetlana's watercolor paintings have traveled the globe. They have been exhibited not only in Israel, but Europe as well as United States. All of her exhibits expressed a serious sincerity towards her watercolors and a love for art. The paintings which Ms. Lukash composed can be found in private collections in U.S.A., Israel and Europe, and museums alike. </p>

                                                <p>In her paintings, Svetlana Lukash exalts the purity of aesthetic forms, the transparence of color and compositional harmony. Her transparent watercolor dabs do not pretend to imitate nature but rather intend to give it an original structural and emotional interpretation. Her draughtsmanship is virtuoso, as well as her ability to express the smallest nuances.
                                                        The litmus test of the creative process for Lukash is the ability to design rich color systems. She perceives the need sometimes to sacrifice the variety of colors in order to focus on a more restricted, carefully selected, color scale. Her dominant colors range between shades of greenish-blue and those of orange-yellow and brown. The richness of color results from producing rich tones of the same shade and combining them with complementary tones. Complex interrelations of contrasting and complementary colors produce a sublime lyrical harmony, which is at the same time warmly emotional and expressive.
                                                        Intensive brushstrokes, intermittently gentle and energetic, are typical of Lukashâ€™s still life and landscape paintings. The latter are especially fascinating in their spontaneity: brushstrokes are swift and rhythmical, aiming to capture the ever-changing moods of nature. Colors permute with the variations of light and shade at different hours of the day, changes of weather and of the emotional atmosphere...
